The app tracks the number of the times the user Walks / Runs per day. Each time the user Walks, he puts this event into the app.
After each walking, the user has one hour to stand again and puts the standing event into the app again. Otherwise the app notifies the user via a notification with snooze/cancel actions.
The process starts from 9 AM to 9 PM.
The app also shows the collected data in a daily chart.
All data of the app stores into an encrypted database.
